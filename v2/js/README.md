This is the javascript code for the barebones graphs that you see on my website: www.kinasmith.com/compostsensor

I'm using the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and I got into the basics of it by looking at [the Sparkfun/Phant.io tutorial](http://phant.io/graphing/google/2014/07/07/graphing-data/). 

I am not a web developer or well versed in Javascript. This is a hack and I'm sure could be done better. I am sharing it because it is the other aspect of this project which might be useful to someone.

There is better documentation out there on Google.
